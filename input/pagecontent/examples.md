We can't do samples due to distribution issues, so here are some examples you can do from home!

In this IG we work with the world renown MixedDrink, the [Cuba Libre](Medication-CubaLibre.html)!

By taking two Substances:

* [Rum: The Best Drink in the Islands](Substance-Rum.html)
* [Cola](Substance-Cola.html)

In appropriate measures, good times are created and governments overthrown.

Each of these drinks are [ordered](MedicationRequest-GimmeADrink.html) and [dispensed](MedicationDispense-YourDrinkSir.html) in the time-honoured tradition.

Once enough good times are had or the government has fallen, whichever comes first, then it's time to pay the piper.  You do this via the [Invoice](Invoice-MyBill.html) which is filled with sometimes costly [ChargeItems](ChargeItem-CubaLibreCharge.html).
